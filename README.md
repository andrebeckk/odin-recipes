# odin-recipes

It’s time to put all of the HTML knowledge I've been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time I’ve finished.

But it’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; I'll revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.
